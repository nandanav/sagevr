## Usage

This project will require an OpenAI API Key in order to work. Once the API key is obtained, go into the Assets folder and open the InteractionHandler script

Find the variable for the OpenAI API Key and input it. Once done, make sure to follow along with Meta docs to get the game loaded onto your Oculus VR.
